# Mitigating Hyperthermia Risk in Artificial Squirrel Domiciles

## Overview

This repository hosts the English version of "Mitigating Hyperthermia Risk in Artificial Squirrel Domiciles: An Evidence-Based Guide to Thermal Management and Design."

Due to climate change and the urban heat island effect, wildlife—especially animals like squirrels that use enclosed spaces for shelter—are facing severe thermal stress. The "artificial nest box paradox," where well-intentioned nest boxes can become dangerous ovens due to improper design, highlights the critical need for scientifically informed construction.

This guide aims to provide a comprehensive and actionable framework for designing, placing, and managing thermally safe domiciles for squirrels.

## Key Contents

This guide provides detailed information on the following topics:

-   **Scientific Foundations of Thermal Risk**: The principles of heat transfer within a nest box and the physiological reasons squirrels are vulnerable to hyperthermia.
-   **Foundational Strategies**: The most critical and cost-effective placement techniques, such as prioritizing shade and proper orientation.
-   **Architectural Design**: Structural considerations to maximize passive cooling, including ventilation, material selection, and drainage.
-   **Advanced Thermal Mitigation**: Strategies for high-risk environments, such as reflective paint (high albedo), insulation, and double-roof systems.
-   **Holistic Habitat Support**: The importance of hydration and the selection of appropriate seasonal nesting materials.
